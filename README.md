# Towards efficient and safe blockchain

Nowadays, blockchain is a pervasive technology, with promising  applications in finance (with cryptocurrencies), market platforms (with non fungible tokens), and decentralized computing (with smart contracts).

To serve the increasing demand, blockchain systems must rely on efficient and safe building blocks, such as BFT consensus. State of the art consensus protocol now serve tens of thousands request per second.

Surprisingly, blockchain systems basing on these protocols never reach such performance with an end to end throughput lower by two orders of magnitude.

This project aims at building a blockchain approaching the performance of HotStuff, the state of art BFT consensus protocol.
